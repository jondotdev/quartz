Salty Beaches spans most of [[The Feast]]'s borders, their white sandy stretches periodically broken by chains mounted to the edges of the tongue. These chains descend to the bases of the tooth mountains. Although surrounded by saltwater, the chains hold fast and retain a lustrous sheen. Only strong Magic can damage these chains forged by the old gods. And even this damage does not last, as they quickly grow back in order to hold the tongue fast and keep [[The Feast]] secure. Many young mages are shipped to the Salty Beaches to toil away in the sun, extracting the metal of these chains, before they are permitted to pursue a career anywhere else. Other than these up-and-coming mages, most of the workforce here is made up of the miners that venture daily out to the [[Teeth Mountains]] to harvest enamel.
The beaches cannot be all work, of course. There is quite a bit of business in travel. Many of the inland dwellers love to visit the soft sand, relax to the creaks of the chains, and bask in the view of the pearly white mountains. And there is also the somewhat controversial tourism business bringing these from the Endless Waters over the mountains into the cities of The Salty Beaches and [[The Sweet]]. A few welcome the outsiders, but most know that they only visit to take the resources within [[The Feast]] just to drown them in their [[Unending Waters]].
