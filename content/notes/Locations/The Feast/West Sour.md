Even flatter than the plains of The Sweet, West Sour is the land of livestock. It is populated by small townships surrounded by fields of grazing land dotted with standalone farmhouses and stables. Most vegetables and fruits eaten in The Feast are harvested in the wild. so most of the land in West Sour is just for the animals to roam, protected by their ranchers. Some of the ranchers from the south end even hard their animals through the short stretch of Umami forest trails to let them graze in The Sweet- much the the disdain of the clans there. But other than that, West Sour keeps to its borders and trades meat, leather, and other animal products in their bordering cities at pretty fair prices, as they enjoy their way of life and do not feel like they need any more.
