Thick with bluish purple trees, the Umami Forest serves as the border between [[The Sweet]], [[East Sour]], [[West Sour]], and [[The Bitter]]. The far reaches that border the other lands are not very notable- save for being a refuge for bandits. But at its heart lives a reclusive tribe well-versed in magic. They leave their home only to trade crystals with [[The Sweet]] and to journey through [[The Bitter]] on their "pilgrimage" to [[The Void]]. It is not known for sure why they do this, other than religious reasons, and they are left to their privacy. But almost anyone in [[The Bitter]] could tell you that their group of pilgrims tends to return to the Umami Forest smaller than it had been when it arrived at the edge of [[The Void]].
