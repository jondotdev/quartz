If so, then this certainly was one. And if not, this must be the closest they came in all their eternity to a mistake. When the titans were sealed away into Tartarus¬†they allowed one to remain and serve its sentence in the sea, ever chained to the rocky depths. This titan, the youngest of its kin, was Hunger. Its gnashing teeth had leveled\nmountains and cities, had devoured both rich and poor, and did all in its power to appease its insatiable appetite. The gods took pity on this Titan, barely anything more than a beast. After all, perhaps if it had only been fed well as a child it would be but an amiable giant.\nAnd so it was cast into the waters, held down by unbreaking chains but gifted with an eternal feast. And while it was still not enough to quench the everlasting ache in its gut. The feast was the closest this titan had ever known to joy.\nOf course, when the old gods were removed and the Titans rose again to take their place in the heavens, they paid no heed to their younger sibling, and neither did the fleeing old ones. From its bed of chains and salty water, Hunger watched the rise and fall of the Titans, and those who came after, as though basking in the rising and setting sun.¬†\nIf the old gods had simply thrown Hunger down to Tartarus, they would be laid to peaceful rest with their siblings, instead of watching their stories played out in ancient constellations so many times over that they knew the stars better than the sky itself.\nBeing left upon the mortal plane left Hunger- although themself immortal- prone to rot. Even battered by the winds and salts of the sea it did not come quickly but, as it always is with rot, it slowly withered away the body of Hunger, leaving naught but sinew and bone. So it rests upon the seafloor, only its skull remaining above the waves. Its mouth hung agape, all but unscathed by the rot that had overtaken its entire body. After all, the old gods had decreed that Hunger may never cease to enjoy their feast.\nSo now, even as generations of gods have risen and been laid to rest, the feast thrives. They know nothing of the world other than the tongue they trod upon, the roof of the mouth that hangs so far above, raining down saliva from time to time, but generally inconsequential. They craft tools of twisted strands of tastebud and forge metals of titan enamel harvested from the mountainous borders of their known world. It is a surprisingly peaceful existence. After all, they are only being eaten, not consumed.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/East-Sour":{"title":"East Sour","content":"East Sour is a land of enterprise and manufacturing. Tall towers and sprawling warehouses cover the land, constructed from a plethora of materials imported from all over [[The Feast]]. They house a multitude of artificers who push to reach new levels of technology and efficiency with the limited palette of resources found in the Rooted Maw. The rest of [[The Feast]] tend to remain peaceful with East Sour, not wanting to risk their trade relations breaking down. They instead resort to waging a large complicated game of careful negotiations to keep them from charging outrageous prices. Periods of high revenue leaves the rest of the population-those not just obsessed with progress- lots of free time to pursue strange and unconventional artistic hobbies.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/Salty-Beaches":{"title":"Salty Beaches","content":"Salty Beaches spans most of [[The Feast]]'s borders, their white sandy stretches periodically broken by chains mounted to the edges of the tongue. These chains descend to the bases of the tooth mountains. Although surrounded by saltwater, the chains hold fast and retain a lustrous sheen. Only strong Magic can damage these chains forged by the old gods. And even this damage does not last, as they quickly grow back in order to hold the tongue fast and keep [[The Feast]] secure. Many young mages are shipped to the Salty Beaches to toil away in the sun, extracting the metal of these chains, before they are permitted to pursue a career anywhere else. Other than these up-and-coming mages, most of the workforce here is made up of the miners that venture daily out to the [[Teeth Mountains]] to harvest enamel.\nThe beaches cannot be all work, of course. There is quite a bit of business in travel. Many of the inland dwellers love to visit the soft sand, relax to the creaks of the chains, and bask in the view of the pearly white mountains. And there is also the somewhat controversial tourism business bringing these from the Endless Waters over the mountains into the cities of The Salty Beaches and [[The Sweet]]. A few welcome the outsiders, but most know that they only visit to take the resources within [[The Feast]] just to drown them in their [[Unending Waters]].","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/The-Bitter":{"title":"The Bitter","content":"**THE BITTER** - Nobody really wishes to reside in The Bitter, but despite this, it remains rather heavily populated. Its reddish-purple vegetation would render it absolutely beautiful, were it not wrought with acrid smog billowing out of [[The Void]] to the north. Even when the Southern Winds blow in, pushing the smog back, The Bitter gets no rest, for the [[South Wind]] brings the rain, and in The Bitter, the rain stings. Even [[The River]] that flows out of [[Umami Forest]] begins to burn as it makes its slow but certain journey to [[The Void]]. \nThe Bitter is filled with towers. akin to [[East Sour]], but many of them are in varying states of disrepair. and anyone talented enough to do any more than basic maintenance usually escape to [[East Sour]] or [[Salty Beaches]] as soon as they can. \nTherefore, The Bitter's population is made. up of the outcasts of [[The Feast]] and the children of those outcasts who were not lucky enough to make it back. The few elites here gain their status by exploiting the rest, either with sheer sweatshop labor, or with the dangerous- but very lucrative- task of acid harvesting from [[The Void]]. This [[Void Acid]] is used to power all sorts of machines.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/The-Sweet":{"title":"The Sweet","content":"The Sweet is primarily made up of serene, gently rolling plains that stretch from the southern Salty Beaches up to the center of the Umami Forests. It is sparse of much tastebud vegetation, containing just knee-high grasses and occasional shrubby trees. Other than a few cities to the south constructed of enamel, and a couple to the north built from Umami trees, the Sweet is untouched by permanent structures. It is inhabited by wandering clans that roam and harvest varieties of the sugar crystals growing amongst the grasses. Most of these crystals are used in food, as they are the primary way to break down the tough tastebud vegetables to make them more palatable, Some rare strains of sugar crystals, however, contain magical properties as well. These strains are very sought after as they fetch a very high price in the cities, and also see use by the clans themselves. The harvesting clans follow a very strict code of morals, leaving them generally peaceful with one another even when disputes about harvesting grounds arise. But some of the larger clans work to subvert these codes to hinder the other clans, leading to civil but brutal inter-clan fighting and espionage.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/Umami-Forest":{"title":"Umami Forest","content":"Thick with bluish purple trees, the Umami Forest serves as the border between [[The Sweet]], [[East Sour]], [[West Sour]], and [[The Bitter]]. The far reaches that border the other lands are not very notable- save for being a refuge for bandits. But at its heart lives a reclusive tribe well-versed in magic. They leave their home only to trade crystals with [[The Sweet]] and to journey through [[The Bitter]] on their \"pilgrimage\" to [[The Void]]. It is not known for sure why they do this, other than religious reasons, and they are left to their privacy. But almost anyone in [[The Bitter]] could tell you that their group of pilgrims tends to return to the Umami Forest smaller than it had been when it arrived at the edge of [[The Void]].","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Feast/West-Sour":{"title":"West Sour","content":"Even flatter than the plains of The Sweet, West Sour is the land of livestock. It is populated by small townships surrounded by fields of grazing land dotted with standalone farmhouses and stables. Most vegetables and fruits eaten in The Feast are harvested in the wild. so most of the land in West Sour is just for the animals to roam, protected by their ranchers. Some of the ranchers from the south end even hard their animals through the short stretch of Umami forest trails to let them graze in The Sweet- much the the disdain of the clans there. But other than that, West Sour keeps to its borders and trades meat, leather, and other animal products in their bordering cities at pretty fair prices, as they enjoy their way of life and do not feel like they need any more.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-River":{"title":"The River","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/The-Void":{"title":"The Void","content":"**THE VOID**- is quite a peculiar place. It is not spoken of much anywhere outside [[The Bitter]], except by the reclusive [[Umami Forest Tribe]] The [[North Wind]] brings a cloud of acrid smog out of it, held back from reaching any further than [[The Bitter ]]by its towers. Unbeknownst to most of [[The Feast]], many workers from [[The Bitter]] venture into The Void daily, to harvest [[Void Acid]] from the walls. This [[Void Acid]] is refined into fuels before ever leaving [[The Bitter]], and is its main export. Most of the harvesting happens during the [[North Wind]]. Despite all the smog, it is much safer than harvesting the [[South Wind]], which is incredibly strong on the edges of The Void, and threatens to suck workers down into the darkness.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Locations/Unending-Waters":{"title":"Unending Waters","content":"The ocean across the [[Teeth Mountains]] from [[The Feast]]","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Materials/Void-Acid":{"title":"Void Acid","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/North-Wind":{"title":"North Wind","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/People-Groups/Umami-Forest-Tribe":{"title":"Umami Forest Tribe","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/South-Wind":{"title":"South Wind","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]},"/notes/The-Seasons":{"title":"The Seasons","content":"**Seasons**- The Feast is split into two seasons: the [[North Wind]] and the [[South Wind]].\nThe [[South Wind]] brings a dry, somewhat salty air into [[The Feast]] from The [[Unending Waters]], and the [[North Wind]] brings damp, foul air out from [[The Void]]. Luckily, the towers of [[The Bitter]] trap most of the polluted smog before it can reach anywhere further, so all that remains for the rest of [[The Feast]] is a moist warm breeze. There are periods of calm between each wind of varying lengths, but never is the same wind repeated twice in a row.","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T17:03:49.857725777Z","tags":[]}}
