East Sour is a land of enterprise and manufacturing. Tall towers and sprawling warehouses cover the land, constructed from a plethora of materials imported from all over [[The Feast]]. They house a multitude of artificers who push to reach new levels of technology and efficiency with the limited palette of resources found in the Rooted Maw. The rest of [[The Feast]] tend to remain peaceful with East Sour, not wanting to risk their trade relations breaking down. They instead resort to waging a large complicated game of careful negotiations to keep them from charging outrageous prices. Periods of high revenue leaves the rest of the population-those not just obsessed with progress- lots of free time to pursue strange and unconventional artistic hobbies.
