**THE BITTER** - Nobody really wishes to reside in The Bitter, but despite this, it remains rather heavily populated. Its reddish-purple vegetation would render it absolutely beautiful, were it not wrought with acrid smog billowing out of [[The Void]] to the north. Even when the Southern Winds blow in, pushing the smog back, The Bitter gets no rest, for the [[South Wind]] brings the rain, and in The Bitter, the rain stings. Even [[The River]] that flows out of [[Umami Forest]] begins to burn as it makes its slow but certain journey to [[The Void]]. 
The Bitter is filled with towers. akin to [[East Sour]], but many of them are in varying states of disrepair. and anyone talented enough to do any more than basic maintenance usually escape to [[East Sour]] or [[Salty Beaches]] as soon as they can. 
Therefore, The Bitter's population is made. up of the outcasts of [[The Feast]] and the children of those outcasts who were not lucky enough to make it back. The few elites here gain their status by exploiting the rest, either with sheer sweatshop labor, or with the dangerous- but very lucrative- task of acid harvesting from [[The Void]]. This [[Void Acid]] is used to power all sorts of machines.
