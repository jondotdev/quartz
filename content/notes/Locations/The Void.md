**THE VOID**- is quite a peculiar place. It is not spoken of much anywhere outside [[The Bitter]], except by the reclusive [[Umami Forest Tribe]] The [[North Wind]] brings a cloud of acrid smog out of it, held back from reaching any further than [[The Bitter ]]by its towers. Unbeknownst to most of [[The Feast]], many workers from [[The Bitter]] venture into The Void daily, to harvest [[Void Acid]] from the walls. This [[Void Acid]] is refined into fuels before ever leaving [[The Bitter]], and is its main export. Most of the harvesting happens during the [[North Wind]]. Despite all the smog, it is much safer than harvesting the [[South Wind]], which is incredibly strong on the edges of The Void, and threatens to suck workers down into the darkness.
