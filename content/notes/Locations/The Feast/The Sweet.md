The Sweet is primarily made up of serene, gently rolling plains that stretch from the southern Salty Beaches up to the center of the Umami Forests. It is sparse of much tastebud vegetation, containing just knee-high grasses and occasional shrubby trees. Other than a few cities to the south constructed of enamel, and a couple to the north built from Umami trees, the Sweet is untouched by permanent structures. It is inhabited by wandering clans that roam and harvest varieties of the sugar crystals growing amongst the grasses. Most of these crystals are used in food, as they are the primary way to break down the tough tastebud vegetables to make them more palatable, Some rare strains of sugar crystals, however, contain magical properties as well. These strains are very sought after as they fetch a very high price in the cities, and also see use by the clans themselves. The harvesting clans follow a very strict code of morals, leaving them generally peaceful with one another even when disputes about harvesting grounds arise. But some of the larger clans work to subvert these codes to hinder the other clans, leading to civil but brutal inter-clan fighting and espionage.
